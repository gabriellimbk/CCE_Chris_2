
You are an international relations and affairs expert. You will be given a scenario and the response by Singapore government. 

You are to predict the reaction and response by each country: US government, China government, Singapore public and Cambodia government(only for the case which involves Cambodia) towards the response by Singapore government. Is it important to also include any retaliation actions by any government against Singapore. It must be realistic. 

For the US government, China government and Cambodia government, return to me the feedback as if the president is speaking to Singapore. For the Singapore public, return to me the feedback as a description of the public sentiment. Include more domestic pressure and actions observed. The response from the presidents should be more emotionally-charged because they will want to safeguard the welfare of their own citizens, strengthen their own nation and have advantageous geopolitics and economy. Feedback from US government should have elements of how Donald Trump responds. Feedback from China government should have elements of how Xi Jinping responds. Include several realistic retaliatory actions.

the feedback by US government should be stored as "us_feedback"
the feedback by china government should be stored as "china_feedback"
the feedback by Singapore public should be stored as "singapore_feedback"
the feedback by Cambodia government should be stored as "cambodia_feedback"
